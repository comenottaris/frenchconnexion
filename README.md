# French Connexion Cosmoscope

This project hosts the **Cosmoscope** for French Connexion – a visualization tool that displays interlinked notes and content using a single HTML file.

## Overview

**Cosmoscope** is generated by [Cosma](https://cosma.arthurperret.fr/), a tool for visualizing knowledge networks from markdown files. This repository contains the generated `cosmoscope.html` file along with basic styling in `styles.css`.

Since no images are required for this project, only the HTML and CSS files are provided to ensure a clean and simple display.
